Jordan,

According to Larsen, both of your concerns have been addressed. Check out
the staging site at www.buttoutnow.com:7070

Unfortunately, my computer setup does not allow me to look at screensavers.
I am getting this issue resolved as soon as possible but let me know if you
have any more concerns.

If I don’t hear from you, congratulations and good luck next week!

Jason

Have they also looked into my complaint that there is a palpable three-or-so
second delay from when you click “exit” until you’re “released” back to your
computer?

Hi Jordan,

I believe it has been taken care of on the buttoutnow staging site, but am
waiting for confirmation from Larsen. I will let you know as soon as I find
out.

Thanks,
Jason

Jason —

Still waiting to find out the fix on the “Falling Apart” screensaver. As I
reported last week, the current model doesn’t appear to have ANY audio (and I
did ensure that the mute button was unchecked).

Please update me on this situation so we may make the new screensaver live.
