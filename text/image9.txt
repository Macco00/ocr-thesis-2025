Dear Dr. Leake,

Thank you for sending me the interesting results from your 
evaluation of 3M's Expantrol V intumescent granules. While the 
results do not initially appear encouraging, at least they offer 
possible directions for improvement. Some ideas immediately come
to mind:

- Change the particle size to optimize adherence. We have 
recently determined that smaller particles give better 
adherence.

-Restrict use of the additive to only filter cigarettes to
eliminate the grit problem. Our results also show some
filters work better than others in preventing particle 
migration.

-Bond the particles to a percentage of the tobacco in
"secondary" casing operation using a water solution.

3M will be meeting with our tobacco consultant, Mr. Robert 
Cundiff, in early February to explore additional "new" approaches 
to possibly incorporating Expantrol V into cigarettes. We would 
appreciate continuing our discussions with American Tobacco 
and thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,
Alan J. Marlof
Product Development Manager
