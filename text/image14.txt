RE:     Winston Advertising  

As you are now aware of the 20¢ buy down on Winston cigarettes is through the end  
of August. This extension coincides with the major advertising campaign entitled  
“Winston No Bull” — about our brand. This campaign not only promotes the new  
packaging, but more importantly the fact that Winston contains “No Additives”.  

To tie-in with the “No Bull” theme we have authorized three pieces of P.O.S.  
advertising.

- Business Hour Sign  
- Push / Pull Door Sign  
- “No Bull” Outdoor Banner to be used whenever possible  
  and a smaller window sign version.  

Your R.J.R. representative will provide the material on their next store call.

We are receiving an allowance in addition to the buy down for supporting  
this promotion. Please make certain we cooperate with the posting of the material  
through Labor Day.

This advertising will be extended through the remainder of 1997
