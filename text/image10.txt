SUBJECT: Fire Safety Project Update
DATE: May 11, 1992

As you know, Paul Warner and I will be in Maine for focus groups later this week, and
things went very well recently in Tucson. When I return I’ll give you a complete update on
the research, but in the meantime, I’ve attached an updated progress chart.

Just a few notes here:

Tucson
We learned a lot in Tucson. The community is fascinating, with its mix of black, white,
Hispanic and Indian cultures. There is a “fire” culture there I’ve not seen before. Setting
little fires is very common and seems to be considered a rite of passage; a “boys will be
boys” kind of thing. My preliminary thought is that our challenge will be to craft messages
that challenge the de facto acceptance of this type of arson by showing people that this
behavior has serious consequences and should not be accepted. I also think a smoke detector
component is appropriate.

We also tested materials developed last year and gained valuable insights. In particular, we
may have to change the art for the brochure on children playing with fire. Both groups of
citizens from the target area were concerned that putting the matches next to the toys in the
illustration made it look like a toy. Interestingly, when we showed the brochure to the
“community leaders” group, which included a number of educators, no one picked up on
this. They reacted to the words, not the picture. It was only after Paul reported what the
citizens group said that the educators agreed. It was a dramatic example of the need to
conduct market research with members of the target audience and not just leaders.

Peoria
The project is going extremely well in Peoria, where about 200 smoke detector requests have
been received from the target area. Chief Russell reported that there was a fire in the target
area last week, which claimed the lives of three people, including two children. A smoke
detector was found on the floor — with a battery still wrapped in plastic packaging materials.
(This was not a detector distributed under the program; Peoria is installing and testing all—
