Subject: Marketing Regulation Manual

We need to revise the corporate principles and perhaps some other sections relating to it and Youth
Smoking Prevention in the Marketing Regulation Manual to reflect the changes we just announced in the
Informer and the reprinting of the brochure. Please take a look at what we have and get Brian to review
with you the changes we need to make in it before you prepare a draft for me.
