Re: Chain Information Sheet

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The South Florida Region is in the process of updating all Chain Information and communicating
this to all Sales & Retail Reps. Please complete the attached form and fax back to my attention at
the South Florida ROU (305-735-9714.) As information, Value-Added Promotions and other
Programs are sent out in a Weekly Chain Calendar. If you would like to be copied on the
calendar, please let me know.

If we have a current Plan-o-Gram, it will be indicated on the sheet. Please check the fax cover
sheet for any additional information needed.

Thank you for your cooperation. As we complete each chain, we will mail you a copy of what is
sent out to the Field.

Sincerely,
Gail
